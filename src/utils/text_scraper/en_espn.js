  title: 'Barnwell: 10 NFL trade candidates, and proposing deals that make sense',

  text: `As recently as five years ago, a column about midseason trades would have been more of a wish list than anything else. NFL teams rarely traded veteran players at all, let alone in the middle of campaigns. Last season alone, though, we saw Amari Cooper, Eli Apple, Damon Harrison, Josh Gordon, Golden Tate, Dante Fowler Jr., Ha Ha Clinton-Dix and Demaryius Thomas all change teams during the season, and that's without even counting the Khalil Mack megatrade, which took place eight days before the season began.

  A wild offseason only stoked the trade winds further. With superstars holding out and/or unexpectedly leaving their teams over the past few weeks, the trade possibilities have grown more obvious. We still have just over three weeks to go before the trade deadline on Oct. 29, but now is about the time when teams should start thinking about whether they should make a move before things get too deep into the season.`
