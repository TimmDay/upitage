  title: "Joseph Maguire, Acting D.N.I., Holds His Ground",
  text: `Mr. Maguire became the acting director of national intelligence last month. Almost immediately, a whistle-blower complaint plunged him into crisis. WASHINGTON — For days, the nation’s top intelligence official found himself wedged between lawmakers eager to see a potentially explosive whistle-blower complaint and other Trump administration officials who deemed it off-limits.

  Senior intelligence officials described Joseph Maguire, who became acting director of national intelligence last month, as reeling from accusations that he broke the law by keeping the complaint from Congress. Mr. Maguire, a retired three-star admiral who friends and allies say did not want the job and was unprepared to wage a political battle, now finds himself trying to protect his reputation, former officials familiar with the workings of his office said.
  
  But he is learning as he goes, friends said. And he will face his most public test yet on Thursday when he testifies before lawmakers about his refusal to hand over the complaint, which is said to sound an alarm about President Trump’s dealings with Ukraine and has seized Washington in recent days, prompting Democrats to announce a formal impeachment inquiry.
